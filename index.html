          Your CO<sub>2</sub> Electricity Emissions: 
          <span id="electricity-result"></span> KWh/year. To lower your Electricity consumptions take the following steps:-
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Choose the right light</li>
          <p class="text">
            LED bulbs are the most energy efficient lighting option. LED bulbs
            use 75% less electricity than incandescent bulbs (Energy Star). The
            also have no mercury, and last about 25 times longer than
            traditional incandescent bulbs (DoE)
          </p>
          <li>Don't keep unnecessary application connected to power</li>
          <p class="text">
            Devices like televisions, microwaves, scanners, and printers use
            standby power, even when off. Some chargers continue to pull small
            amounts of energy, even when plugged in (a good judge of this is if
            a charger feels warm to the touch).
          </p>
          <li>Turn off the lights when not in room/going out.</li>
          <p class="text">
            Two 100-watt incandescent bulbs switched off an extra two hours per
            day could save you Rs 1000 over a year. Better yet, switch to LED. Just
            one switch and you're done!
          </p>
        </ol>
      </div>


      <div id="fuel-output" >
        <p>Your CO<sub>2</sub> Fuel Emission: <span id="fuel-result"></span> KG/Year. To lower your fuel consumptions take the following steps:-</p>
        <p></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Drive only when needed or use Public Transport</li>
          <p class="text">
            Drive your car only when you really need to. If you only need to
            travel a few blocks, consider walking or even riding a bicycle. Not
            only will you save money at the pump, the exercise will certainly do
            you some good
          </p>
          <li>Use cruise control on the highways.</li>
          <p class="text">
            Cruise control means that your car will be going at a constant
            velocity, which means there is no acceleration. No acceleration
            reduces the amount of work your engine does, and therefore it uses
            less gas. You should set your cruise control at the speed limit,
            because 55 miles per hour is the perfect speed for maximum fuel
            efficiency
          </p>
          <li>Avoid Keeping the car on at Red Lights</li>
          <p class="text">
            When you do need to drive your car, make sure you avoid idling
            whenever possible. When your car is running, but not moving, your
            gas mileage is absolute zero. So if your car will remain stationary
            for more than a minute or so, switch the engine off. However, only
            do this when it is safe to do so
          </p>

      </div>
      <div id="lpg-output" >
        <p>Your CO<sub>2</sub> LPG Emission: <span id="lpg-result"></span> KG/Year . To lower your LPG consumptions take the following steps:-</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Use pressure cookers</li>
          <p class="text">
            Use pressure cookers whenever possible. Since food is cooked under
            pressure inside a pressure cooker, it gets cooked really fast (70%
            faster than conventional cooking techniques) and thus uses less
            fuel.
          </p>
          <li>Avoid Overcooking</li>
          <p class="text">
            Overcooking reduces the nutritional value and also wastes LPG. So
            avoid overcooking the food.
          </p>
          <li>Cover and Cook</li>
          <p class="text">
            Cover the cookware or the pan with a lid while you cook. When we
            close and cook the energy is used more efficiently and so cooking
            becomes faster. Saves time and saves fuel.
          </p>

      <div id="waste-output">
        <p>Your CO<sub>2</sub> Waste Emission: <span id="waste-result"></span> kilograms per year. To lower your waste productions take the following steps:-</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The three R’s – Reduce, Reuse and Recycle </li>
          <p class="text">
              Reduce, Reuse, Recycle – these three 'R' words are an important part of sustainable living, as they help to cut down on the amount of waste we have to throw away.
  
              It's Really simple!
              <ul >
              <li class="text">Reduce the amount of waste you produce.</li>
              <li class="text">Reuse items as much as you can before replacing them.</li>
              <li class="text">Recycle items wherever possible.</li>
              </ul>
              
             <span style="font-size: 1.1rem;">Using the 3 'R's also helps to minimise the amount of space needed for landfill sites, where waste materials are disposed of.</span>
          </p>
          <li>Ditch the plastic bags.</li>
          <p class="text">One of the simplest ways to decrease the amount of waste you produce is to use reusable bags while shopping. Instead of relying on your supermarket’s plastic bags, bring your own cloth ones to pack up your items and tote them home. Keeping a bunch of extra bags in the trunk of your car or right by the door is an easy way to make sure you don’t forget them at home.
          </p>
          <li>Start Composting</li>
          <p class="text">
              Every day, a large amount of what you throw into the trash could be composted and returned to the earth. If you have a bin and some extra space, you can easily start a compost that could feed back into your garden. Your excess food won’t go to waste, your garden will be full of nutrients and you can feel better about your impact on the planet. Win, win, win.
